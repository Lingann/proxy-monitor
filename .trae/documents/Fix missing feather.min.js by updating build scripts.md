I have identified the cause of the error. The file `feather.min.js` is located in `src/renderer/lib`, but the build and development scripts in `package.json` are not copying this directory to the `dist` folder where the application looks for it.

The error message you provided (`...ib\feather.min.js`) suggests a missing 'l' character, which aligns with the missing `lib` folder (and potentially a typo in your error report `ingann` vs `lingann`).

Here is the plan to fix it:

1.  **Update `package.json`**:
    -   Modify the `dev` script to copy the `src/renderer/lib` directory to `dist/renderer/lib`.
    -   Update the `build` configuration to include `src/renderer/lib/**/*` in the packaged application.

This ensures that `feather.min.js` is correctly placed in the distribution folder for both development and production builds.
